        <h2>some basic facts</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently based in Rogers, AR, working as a bartender for a local
          brewery, and I have two cats and a husband (that guy in the picture).
          I am a constant work in progress and I love challenging myself to grow
          and evolve. My spirit animal is honestly probably just a regular house
          cat, they are strong and agile when they need to be, but dang they
          know how to take it easy and not stress. I'm an enneagram 9. BYE

          <h3>web developement</h3>
          <p>
            I have really been enjoying learning web developement, it has been
            really challenging and overall rewarding. It takes up like all of my
            time and I'm not mad about it.

          <h3>climbing</h3>
          <p>
            My favorite way to spend my time is climbing, any kind of climbing,
            especially outdoors. I love the focus, strategy and determination it
            takes to get to the top. More than the physical challenge is the
            mental challenge, you have to trust yourself and have the confidence
            to go for something that may seem out of reach. These skills adapt
            easily into other parts of my life as well, and that's pretty cool.

          <h3>framily</h3>
          <p>
            When I'm not doing those other two things (or working) I'm probably
            spending some QT with my friends. Friends are super important to me,
            they are absolutely my chosen family. Guys, I have some really good
            ones, the kind where you just show up at their house, the kind where
            you don't have to call them to make sure you have plans, because you
            know they're solid. They are always down for adventures, whether its
            a spontaneous climb trip, a bike to the brewery, digging through
            dirty bins of clothes at thrift stores, or just staying home and
            sharing a delicious meal.
